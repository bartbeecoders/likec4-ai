# Claude Games

Arcade games built from scratch in vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. No
engine, no framework, no bundler, and no binary assets — every sprite, sound
and font is generated at runtime.

## Games

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Galaga](galaga/)** | The 1981 Namco classic — formation entrances, diving attacks, tractor-beam capture, dual fighter, challenging stages. | [source](galaga/) · [readme](galaga/README.md) |

## Running locally

Nothing to install. Open `index.html`, or serve it:

```sh
npm start          # zero-dependency static server, prints its LAN address
```

Each game also works straight from `file://`, and builds to a single
self-contained HTML file:

```sh
npm run build      # -> galaga/dist/galaga.html
```

## Deploying

The repository root is already a working static site, so any static host will
serve it as-is. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` publishes to GitHub Pages on
every push to `main` — the one-time setup is *Settings → Pages → Source:
**GitHub Actions***.

## Adding a game

Each game is a self-contained folder with its own `index.html`, `src/` and
README. Drop it in, add a card to the root `index.html`, and add a row to the
table above.
